# Q: How long do opportunities typically last? Have the durations changed between the two years?
# Q: Is there a correlation between signups and rejection rates for opportunities?
# Q: Which country's learners are more likely to secure opportunities? Has this changed
# between the two years? Which country's learners are the most competitive (Competition
# opportunties)? How about internships?
